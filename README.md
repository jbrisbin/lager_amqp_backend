# Lager AMQP Backend

This is a backend for the Lager Erlang logging framework.

[https://github.com/basho/lager](https://github.com/basho/lager)

It will send all of your logging messages to the exchange you specify and use the logging level 
as the routing key. It uses a smart connection pool to your broker. If the connection drops or 
becomes unusable, the backend will reconnect.

### Usage

Include this backend into your project using rebar:

    {lager_amqp_backend, ".*", {git, "https://github.com/jbrisbin/lager_amqp_backend.git", "master"}}
